## üîç How It Works

The **Steam Game Recommender** employs a hybrid approach, combining both Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering techniques:

### Content-Based Filtering

This method analyzes the features of games you have liked in the past. For instance, if you enjoy action-adventure games, the system will suggest similar titles based on attributes like genre, gameplay mechanics, and storyline.

### Collaborative Filtering

This technique looks at the behavior of users with similar preferences. If a user with a profile similar to yours enjoyed a specific game, the system will recommend that game to you.

### Data Sources

The application utilizes data from Steam's API to gather game information, user ratings, and reviews. This data is crucial for generating accurate recommendations.
